# autogen-backend

A backend API powered by [Autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen).

A new run is created for every user request sent via websocket and stored in the database. The team state is reset for the user at the completion of every nth run, regardless of the session. (temporary workaround for https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/issues/6227)

The data for vector search is taken from `azure-search-openai-demo` repo.
 

## Use Cases

1. **Generation with APIs** (`WeatherAgent`)
2. **Generation with Vector Search** (`VectorSearchAgent`)

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Azure OpenAI
echo 'export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' >> ~/.zshrc

# PostgresSQL
echo 'export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE' >> ~/.zshrc

# OpenWeather
echo 'export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Run

```bash
# Run db
make run_db

# Run embeddings
make run_embeddings

# Run app
make run_app

# OR run app in docker
make run_app_docker

```

### Test with Postman

```bash
# URL
ws://localhost:8000/ws/chat/session-foo

# Message format
{
  "content": "your message here",
  "source": "user"
